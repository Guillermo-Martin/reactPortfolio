              Hello! My name's Guillermo. I'm from Virginia Beach, Virginia. I have a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Biology from James Madison University and a Master's of Science Degree in Forensic Science with a specialization in criminalistics from the University of Central Oklahoma. I moved to the Bay Area more than 10 years ago when I got a job at the Alameda County Sheriff's Office Crime Lab as a forensic scientist. I worked there for more than 10 years, primarily in the Forensic Biology and DNA unit. I also got to work in latent prints and processed crime scenes.
            </p>

              During the last few years I was there, I gained an interest in coding, particularly in web development. I learned about web development through a class offered by Udemy and really enjoyed it. I decided to quit my job as a forensic scientist to pursue a career in web development. I'm currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp offered by UC Berkeley Extension and I hope to become a front-end web developer.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy eating, exploring the Bay Area, playing video games, reading, and fencing.
